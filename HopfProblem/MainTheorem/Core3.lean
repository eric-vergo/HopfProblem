This module is part of the split of the original single-file `Solution.lean`
of plby/HopfProblem into a thematic module tree.  Full provenance, attribution
and copyright notices are retained in `Solution.lean` at the repository root.
Declarations are verbatim from the original file and keep their original
relative order within each module.  The modules form a single import chain
whose concatenation is a linear extension of the true dependency order of the
original file (computed from the compiled environment): a declaration may
elaborate before some declarations that textually preceded it, but never
before anything it depends on.  Two `private` lemmas whose users fell into a
neighbouring module were made public (`SpecialPeriods.TauCusp.
exists_upperHalfPlane_qParam_small_mo1973_17412` and
`isOpen_qParam_norm_lt_mo1973_17413`); no other declaration text was edited.
